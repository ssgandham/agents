- Chosen Company: **Nvidia**
  - **Why it was chosen:** Nvidia's dominance in the AI GPU sector, capturing 94% of the market share, combined with a strong future outlook due to strategic AI partnerships and innovations in AI infrastructure, offer a robust investment potential. This translates to it being rated as a 'Strong Buy' with a promising price target, supporting its positive outlook amid growing competition.

- Companies Not Selected:
  - **Microsoft:**
    - **Why it was not chosen:** While Microsoft has substantial investments in AI and a robust market position in cloud and software, its market advantage in AI technologies is less pronounced compared to Nvidia's strategic dominance in AI hardware and sector leadership.
  - **Alphabet (Google), Palantir Technologies, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Meta Platforms, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, Snowflake, Quantum Computing:**
    - **Why they were not chosen:** Currently, their market share and AI dominance do not match Nvidia's commanding presence, strategic market leadership, or its specific focus on AI development that aligns with sustained growth in the AI sector.
