After carefully reviewing the arguments from both sides of the debate regarding whether you can make money using SPX, I conclude that the case in favor of the motion is more convincing.

The proponents of the motion highlighted key advantages of investing in the S&P 500 Index, such as its historical average annual return of about 10-11%, its inherent diversification, its ability to recover from market downturns, and the potential for compounding returns. They emphasized that investing in SPX is a means of tapping into the overall growth of the U.S. economy while enjoying lower fees associated with passive management strategies. Additionally, they argued that the liquidity of SPX investments provides easy access to capital, making it an appealing choice for long-term investors.

On the opposing side, while valid points about the risks and limitations associated with SPX investments were made, such as market volatility, the unpredictability of future returns, and potential fees that can diminish profits, these concerns do not sufficiently outweigh the positive attributes previously mentioned. The assertion that past performance does not guarantee future results is a staple of investing in any asset class, not solely SPX. Moreover, the warnings about volatility and market downturns apply broadly across all investments, indicating that prudent investing practices and diversification remain essential regardless of the asset in question.

Ultimately, although the risks associated with SPX investments are real, they do not negate the substantial potential for making money framed by historical trends and the robustness of the index. The arguments supporting the potential profitability of SPX were more compelling and based on a broader understanding of long-term investment principles.

Therefore, the motion is upheld: you can make money using SPX, but it requires a sound investment strategy and an acceptance of inherent market risks.
