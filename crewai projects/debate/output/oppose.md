While there are arguments that one can make money using SPX, it is important to consider the risks and limitations involved in trading or investing in the S&P 500 Index. First and foremost, past performance is not indicative of future results. The average annual return of 10-11% cited is based on historical data, and various global or domestic factors can lead to market downturns, nullifying any potential gains. 

Additionally, the idea that SPX is a stress-free investment is misleading; the volatility of the stock market can lead to significant losses in a short period of time, which can be particularly damaging for those who are not prepared for such fluctuations. Even with a diversified portfolio, there is still a risk that major economic events can negatively impact the index, resulting in decreased value. 

Moreover, investors should be aware of the fees associated with SPX-based investments and how they can eat into overall returns, particularly for short-term traders. Since the SPX is influenced by several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, relying solely on it for financial growth may not be a sound strategy. 

In conclusion, the notion that one can reliably make money using SPX overlooks the potential for volatility, the risk of downturns, and the importance of a well-rounded investment strategy. Investors may do better to consider the inherent risks and diversify their portfolios rather than rely solely on SPX.
