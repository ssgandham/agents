Investing in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) is one of the most reliable ways to make money in the stock market. The SPX represents a diversified portfolio of 500 of the largest companies in the U.S., which collectively cover approximately 80% of the market capitalization of the entire stock market. Historically, the S&P 500 has provided an average annual return of about 10-11%, making it a solid choice for long-term investors.  

Furthermore, the SPX is resilient, often recovering from market downturns, as seen during various economic cycles. By holding an SPX-based investment, such as an index fund or ETF, investors can benefit from compounding returns over time, while enjoying lower fees due to passive management. Additionally, the liquidity of SPX investments ensures that capital can be easily accessed when needed.  

In summary, investing in SPX allows individuals to tap into the overall growth of the U.S. economy, offers diversification that helps mitigate risks, and provides a relatively stress-free approach to participating in the stock market, showcasing how one can indeed make money using SPX.
