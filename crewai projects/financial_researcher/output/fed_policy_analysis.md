3) Recent Fed Chair statements or speeches (last 7 days)
- Chair Jerome H. Powell — FOMC press conference remarks and transcript, Oct 29, 2025. Key lines reported in coverage and transcript: Powell said policymakers cut rates by 25 bps but indicated that officials are "likely done cutting for now" and that this move may be the last cut of 2025, stressing uncertainty in the labor market and incomplete information. (Source: Transcript: Chair Jerome H. Powell at October 29, 2025 press conference — https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20251029.pdf; Reuters coverage: "Powell: Fed likely done cutting rates — for now", Oct 29, 2025 — https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/powell-fed-likely-done-cutting-rates-for-now-2025-10-29/)

- (No other distinct Powell speeches found on the Federal Reserve site between Oct 23–29 besides the Oct 29 press conference; Oct 29 press conference is within the last 7 days as of Oct 30, 2025.)

4) Market interpretation of Fed policy (hawkish/dovish)
- Short summary of market interpretation: Mixed but leaning dovish on the decision, then pivoting toward a more neutral/hawkish interpretation because Powell signaled cuts may be over.
- Detail and evidence:
  - News coverage described the October 29 cut as dovish in itself (a 25 bps reduction), but Powell’s language at the press conference led markets to conclude policymakers may be pausing further cuts — Reuters: "Stocks mixed after Fed cuts rates, Powell says likely done" (Oct 29, 2025) — indicating a shift from dovish to more neutral/hawkish forward guidance. (Reuters link: https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/stocks-mixed-after-fed-cuts-rates-powell-says-likely-done-2025-10-29/)
  - CNBC and Bloomberg reporting noted that while the cut was intended to support labor market conditions, Powell's comments that officials were "likely done" with cuts in 2025 caused investors to reprice the expected path of rates, pushing Treasury yields higher. (CNBC: "Treasury yields inch higher as investors weigh Fed's latest rate cut", Oct 30, 2025 — https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/us-treasury-yields-investors-weigh-feds-latest-rate-cut-.html; Bloomberg coverage Oct 29, 2025)

5) Impact on equities (Bullish/Bearish/Neutral)
- Overall equity-market impact: Mixed/Neutral-to-Slightly-Bullish for risk assets in the immediate term, but sector-differentiated.
- Evidence and reasoning:
  - Immediate market reaction: U.S. equities were mixed on Oct 29, 2025. Some cyclical and rate-sensitive sectors (e.g., real estate, utilities, some large-cap growth names) initially benefited from the rate cut (dovish impulse), while financials and regional banks underperformed as lower rates compress net interest margins. Reuters noted mixed returns across sectors. (Reuters: https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/stocks-mixed-after-fed-cuts-rates-powell-says-likely-done-2025-10-29/)
  - Powell’s message that cuts may be over prompted a bounce in Treasury yields, which historically is mixed for equities — higher yields can pressure high-valuation growth stocks but reflect confidence in the economy that may support cyclicals. CNBC reported treasury yields rose as investors digested Powell’s guidance (CNBC: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/us-treasury-yields-investors-weigh-feds-latest-rate-cut-.html).
  - Net assessment for equities: Neutral-to-slightly bullish in the short run because the cut removes some near-term policy risk and supports economic activity, but the signal that cuts may pause limits a strong sustained rally. Sector view: rate-sensitive yielders and certain cyclical sectors saw gains; financials generally weaker.
