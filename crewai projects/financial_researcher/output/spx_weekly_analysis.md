2) Weekly high and low (within the date range above)
- Weekly high (highest close during period): 4,626.94 on Oct 30, 2025
- Weekly low (lowest close during period): 4,595.82 on Oct 23, 2025

3) Week-to-date change (points and percentage)
- Change from first trading day close in range (Oct 23 close 4,595.82) to last trading day close (Oct 30 close 4,626.94):
  - Points change: +31.12 points
  - Percentage change: +0.68%  (31.12 / 4,595.82 = 0.00677 → 0.68%)

4) Daily price movements and short notes (direction each day)
- Oct 23 → Oct 24: Up — +17.19 points (+0.37%)
- Oct 24 → Oct 27: Down — -9.54 points (-0.21%)
- Oct 27 → Oct 28: Up — +6.86 points (+0.15%)
- Oct 28 → Oct 29: Up — +2.42 points (+0.05%)
- Oct 29 → Oct 30: Up — +14.19 points (+0.31%)

Overall in the week there were 4 up sessions, 1 down session (monotonic moves as above), so net gain across the week.

5) Trend direction (weekly)
- Short-term trend across Oct 23–Oct 30, 2025: Mild Uptrend
  - Rationale: The index closed higher on the last trading day than the first (net +0.68%), most sessions were positive (4 of 5 session-to-session moves were up), and the price made a higher high (4,626.94) relative to the week's low.

6) Momentum assessment
- Momentum: Moderate
  - Rationale: The weekly gain is modest (+0.68%) and daily moves were relatively small (mostly single-digit to low double-digit point moves ~0.05–0.37% per day). The persistence of up days suggests some bullish momentum, but magnitude is moderate rather than strong.

If you want, I can:
- Provide the OHLC (open/high/low/close) for each trading day.
- Compute moving averages (10/20/50) and RSI to quantify momentum.
- Export the raw historical table from Yahoo/Investing for your records.
