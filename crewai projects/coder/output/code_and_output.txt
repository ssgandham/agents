1. **Approach and Logic Explanation**:
   - The series to calculate is: \(1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \ldots\).
   - This series consists of 10,000 terms, and the nth term can be expressed as: 
     \[
     \text{term}_n = \frac{(-1)^{n}}{(2n + 1)}
     \]
   - The even-indexed terms contribute positively, while the odd-indexed terms contribute negatively.
   - We initialize a variable to accumulate the sum, iterate through the first 10,000 terms, and compute the sum.
   - Finally, we multiply the total sum by 4 to obtain the answer.

2. **Complete Python Code**:
```python
def calculate_series(n_terms):
    total_sum = 0.0
    for n in range(n_terms):
        total_sum += (-1)**n / (2 * n + 1)
    # Multiplying the result by 4, as per the requirement.
    result = total_sum * 4
    return result

# Calculate the first 10,000 terms
number_of_terms = 10000
final_result = calculate_series(number_of_terms)

# Print the result
print(final_result)
```

3. **Expected Output**:
   - The expected output when the code is run is approximately: 
   ```
   3.1414926535900345
   ```
